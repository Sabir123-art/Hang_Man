# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python.

## Description

This Python script allows users to play the classic Hangman game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and provides a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly by suggesting letters. The player gets visual feedback on their incorrect guesses, gradually drawing the hangman figure. The game ends either when the player guesses the word correctly within the specified attempts or when the hangman figure is completed.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script in a compatible environment.
2. Follow the instructions prompted on the console:
   * Enter your name to start the game.
   * Guess letters to reveal the hidden word.
   * Continue guessing until you either guess the word correctly or exhaust your attempts.

## File Structure

* `hangman.py`: The main Python script containing the game logic.
* `README.md`: This file providing information about the game and its usage.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

## How to Play

1. Execute the Python script.
2. Input your name as prompted.
3. Guess letters to uncover the hidden word.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions for the hangman figure and available attempts.
5. Continue guessing until you either win by guessing the word or lose by running out of attempts.
